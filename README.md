# Effect of strigolactones on recruitment of the rice root-associated microbiome, 2022 


This is a repository meant for sharing scripts and data set used for the pulication "Effect of strigolactones on recruitment of the rice root-associated microbiome, 2022 (https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/98/2/fiac010/6524125?login=true)". Raw seqeuncing data can be downloaded here: https://zenodo.org/record/4604914#.YiiOAXrMKbg

There are 4 folders (workflows) here: 
1) W1_phenotypic_data: Strigolactones (SLs), biomass (Fig 1, Fig S2)
2) W2_16S_analysis: processing 16S amplicon sequence, alpha diversity, beta diversity, effect of SL on alpha & beta diversity, PiCRUST2, dataset preparation for W4 (Fig 2, Fig 4, Table S4-S8, Fig S3-S4) 
3) W3_ITS_analysis: processing ITS amplicon sequence, alpha diversity, beta diversity, AMF analysis, effect of SL on alpha & beta diversity, dataset preparation for W4 (Fig 2-4, Table S4-S7, Table S9, Fig S3-S4) 
4) W4_correlation_study: Correlation between the level of SLs and the relative abundance of ASV/genus/pathway/EC (Fig 5, Table S10-13)

In each folder, there are script and workimage that can reproduce the results presented in the paper.
