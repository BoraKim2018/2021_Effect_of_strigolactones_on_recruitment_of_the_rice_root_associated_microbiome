# Strigolactone structural specificity in microbiome recruitment in rice, 2021


This is a repository meant for sharing scripts and data set used for the pulication "Strigolactone structural specificity in microbiome recruitment in rice, 2021"

There are 4 folders (workflows) here: 
1) W1_phenotypic_data: Strigolactones (SLs), biomass (Fig 1, Fig S2)
2) W2_16S_analysis: processing 16S amplicon sequence, alpha diversity, beta diversity, effect of SL on alpha & beta diversity, PiCRUST2, dataset preparation for W4 (Fig 2, Fig S2, Fig 4)
3) W3_ITS_analysis: processing ITS amplicon sequence, alpha diversity, beta diversity, explore AMF, effect of SL on alpha & beta diversity, dataset preparation for W4 (Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig S2, Fig 4) 
5) W4_correlation_study: correlation between the level of SLs and the relative abundance of ASV/genus/pathway/EC (Fig 5)

In each folder there are 3 files:
1) file name finish with script.pdf: It is documented from script (R markdown). Recommend to see this if you simply check script or workflow. 
2) file name finish with script.rmd: It is actual R markdown file that you can download on your local computer and reproduce the results.  
3) file name finish with image.RData: R image files contains initial dataset for data analysis. It is needed to reproduce the results todgether with script.rmd
