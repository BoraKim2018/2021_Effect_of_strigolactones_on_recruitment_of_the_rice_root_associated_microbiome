# 2021_Strigolactone_structural_specificity_in_microbiome_recruitment_in_rice

This is meant for sharing scripts and data set of pulication "Strigolactone structural specificity in microbiome recruitment in rice, 2021"
This directory comprised with 4 workflows: 

1) W1_phenotypic_data: Strigolactones (SLs), biomass
2) W2_16S_analysis: processing 16S amplicon sequence, alpha diversity, beta diversity, effect of SL on alpha & beta diversity, PiCRUST2, dataset preparation for W4 
3) W3_ITS_analysis: processing ITS amplicon sequence, alpha diversity, beta diversity, explore AMF, effect of SL on alpha & beta diversity, dataset preparation for W4 
5) W4_correlation_study: correlation between the level of SLs and the relative abundance of ASV/genus/pathway/EC
